# devNote Backend

## Overview

The backend for devNote, a simple Note ToDo application, is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides a RESTful API for managing users and their notes, with features like authentication and secure data handling.

This backend handles user registration, login, and supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes.

## Features

### User Authentication:

- Register new users with secure password storage.
  
- Log in using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  
- Protected routes for authenticated users.
  
### CRUD Operations for Notes:

- Create new notes.
  
- Read all or specific notes.

- Update existing notes.
- Delete notes.
- Secure Data Handling:

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
  
- Authentication with JWT for secure session management.

  
## Tech Stack

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.

- Express.js: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
  
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user and notes data.
